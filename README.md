# JDBC_RESULTSET
The SQL statements that read data from a database query, return the data in a result set. 
The SELECT statement is the standard way to select rows from a database and view them in a result set. 
The java.sql.ResultSet interface represents the result set of a database query.  
A ResultSet object maintains a cursor that points to the current row in the result set. 
The term "result set" refers to the row and column data contained in a ResultSet object.
